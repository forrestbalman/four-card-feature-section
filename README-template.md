## My process

### Built with

- Svelte

### What I learned

I got to practice responsive layouts using grid and flexblox. I created 3 separate grids at 3 different breakpoints. I added a medium 2 by 2 grid because the transition from desktop to mobile looked too stretched in and around the 900px mark, but too swuished at around the 500px mark, so i settled on a third layout.
